# Compare clubs in European football leagues
Compare clubs from European football leagues by how they perform during the most recent 2024-25 season, using only the common games they've played.

### How to 
Clone this repository and run the **main.py** file. There are three required arguments: 

 `--country` : "ENG", "ITA", "ESP" 
 
 `--teamA` : "Arsenal", "Inter", "Barcelona"
 
 `--teamB` : same as above 

## Output
Running the script will create a couple files in the same directory: 

   **results.txt** : common games comparison for teamA versus teamB 

   **seasonLeaders.txt** : overall common games leaderboard for the whole league 

The script will also return a chart showing the points for the leader, the runner-up and the top-4 finisher at that point in the season.
